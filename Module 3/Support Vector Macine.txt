** What is Support Vector Macine?
- SVM is a supervised algirithm that classifies cases by finding a separator.
1. Mapping data to high-dimensional feature space
2. Finding a separator


** Mapping data to higher dimensional space is called Kernelling. The mathmatical function used for transformation 
is known as the kernel function, and can be of different types:
 . Linear
 . Polynomial
 . RBF (Radial Basis Function)
 . Sigmoid


** How do we find the right or optimized separator after transformation(eg plot)?
 . So finding the optimized hyperplane can be formalized using an equation which
involves quite a bit more math (search google).



**  Pros and Cons of SVM
 * Advantages:
    . Accurate in high demensional spaces
    . Memory efficient
 * Disadvantages:
    . Prone to over-fitting (over-fitting if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples.)
    . No probability estimation
    . Small datasets (not efficient of the dataset is big eg > 1,000)

** Application
   . Image Recognition
   . Hand written digits Recognition
   . In text mining tasks
   . Detecting spam
   . Sentiment Analysis
   . Gene Expression Classification
   . Regression , Outlier detection and clustering

when to use logistic regression vs linear regression vs SMV?

Choosing between logistic regression, linear regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) depends on the nature of your data and the problem you’re trying to solve. Here’s a quick guide:

Linear Regression

Use When: You want to predict a continuous dependent variable.
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
Characteristics: Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Logistic Regression

Use When: You want to predict a binary outcome (0 or 1).
Example: Predicting whether an email is spam (1) or not (0).
Characteristics: Uses the logistic function to model the probability of the binary outcome, making it suitable for classification tasks.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Use When: You need a powerful classifier, especially in high-dimensional spaces or with non-linear boundaries.
Example: Classifying images, text categorization, or other complex patterns.
Characteristics: Works by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. SVM can also use kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships.

Summary

Linear Regression: Continuous outcomes.
Logistic Regression: Binary outcomes.
SVM: Complex classification tasks, especially with non-linear relationships
