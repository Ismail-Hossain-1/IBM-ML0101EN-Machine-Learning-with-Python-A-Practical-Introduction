General Cost Function
----------------------
The cost function is the difference between actual values of Y and model's output.

cost function (y, y')= 1/2*(y'-y)^2
- How to find the best parameters for model? :- Minimize the cost function
- How to minimize the cost function ? :- Using Gradient Descent
- What is gradient discent? :- A technique to use the derivative of the cost function to change the parameters values, 
   in order to minimize the cost.

Training algorithm
--------------------
1. Initialize the parameters randomly.
2. Feed the cost function with training set, and calculate the error.
3. Calcualte the gradient of the cost function.
4. Update the weights with new values.
5. Go to step to untill the cost is small enough.
6. Predict the new customer X.
