K-Means algorithm
------------------
. Partitioning clustering 
. K- means divides the data in non-overlaping subsets(cluster) without any cluster internal cluster

Distance = euclidian distance(sqrt((x-x')^2+...))

** K-Means Clustering algorithm
---------------------------------
1. Randomly placing k centroids, one for each cluster.
2. Calculate the distance of each point from each centroid.
3. Assign each data point (object) to its closest centroid, creatig a cluster.
4. Recalculate the position of k centroids.
5. Repeat the steps 2-4, untill the centroids no longer move.
