When dealing with aribitrary shaped clusters and clusters within clusters traditional clustering might not be able to achieve good result.

** K-Means vs density-based clustering
----------------------------------------
K-Means assigns all points to a cluster even if they do not belong to any

Density based clustering locates regions with high density, and seperates outliers

* DBSCAN is particularly effective for class identification on a spatial context.

** What is DBSCAN?
 - DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Of Application With Noise)
  . one of the most used clustering
  . based on densith of object
 It works based on 2 parameters:
  > R (Radius of neighborhood)
  > M (Minimun number of neighbors)

  * So, what is a core point?
 -A data point is a core point if within our neighborhood of the point there are at least M points.
 * What is a border point?
A data point is a border point if A; its neighbourhood contains less than M data points or B; it is reachable from some core point.
