Clustering means finding clusters in a dataset, unsupervised.

** What is a cluster?
 -  A group of objects that is similar to other objects in the cluster, and dissimilar
    to data points in other clusters.

** Difference between Clustering and classification
 # classification
  - predicts categorical classed labels(means assigning instance to predefined classes) 
  - Generally, classification is a supervised learning where each data instance belongs to a particular class.

 # Clustering
  - Data is unlabeled and the process is unsupervised.


Application:

- Retail/ Marketing
 . Identifying buying patterns of customers.
 . Recomending new books or movies to new customers.
- Banking
 . Fraud detection in credit card use.
 . Identifying clusters fo customers (eg loyal)
- Insurance
 . Fraud detection in claims analysis
 . Insurance risk of customers
- Publication
 . Auto-categorizing news based on their content
 . Recomending similar news articals
- Medicine
 . Characterizing patients behavior
- Biology
 . Clusterging genetic markers to identify family ties


 ** Why clustering 
 - Exploratory data analysis
 - Summary generation
 - Outlier detection
 - Finding duplicates(fraud)
 - pre-processing steps

 ** Clustering algorithms
  - Partitioned-based clustering
   . Relatively efficient
   . eg K-means, k-Median, Fuzzy c-means
  - Heirarchial clustering
   . produces tree cluster
   . Agglomerative, Divisive
  - Density-based Clustering
   . produces arbitary shaped cluster
   . eg DBSCAN
