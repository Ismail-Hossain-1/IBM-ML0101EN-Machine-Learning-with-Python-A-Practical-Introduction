Dendogram :- A dendogram is a diagram that shows the arrangement of the 
            clusters produced by hierarchial clustering.

** Hierarchical Clustering
---------------------------
Hierarchial clustering algorithm builds a hierarchy of clusters where each node is a cluster
consists of clusters of its daughter node.

* Strategies for hierarchial clustering
------------
    1. Divisive (top down)
    2. Agglomerative (bottom up)


**Agglomerative algorithm
---------------------------

1. Create n cluster,one for each datapoint.
2. Compute the proximity matrix (nXn)
3. Repeat:
        i. Merge the two closest clusters.
        ii. Update the proximity matrix.
4. Until only a single cluster remains.


* How to find closest clusters
Distance between clusters
--------------------------------
 . Single-Linkage Clustering
    . Minimum distance between clusters.
 . Complete-Linkage Clustering
    . Maximum distance between clusters.
 . Average Linkage Clustering
    . Average distance between clusters.
 . Centroid Linkage Clustering
    . Distance between cluster centroids


Advantages vs disadvantages
----------------------------
Advantages:-
 - Doesn't not require the number of clusters to be specified.
 - Easy to implement
 - Produces a dendogram, which helps with understanding the data.
Disadvantages :-
 - Can never undo the previous steps throughout the algorithm
 - Generally has long runtimes.
 - Sometimes difficult to understand the number of clusters by the dendogram.


 ** Hierarchial Clustering vs K-Means
 ---------------------------------------
 K-Means
 ..........
 1. Much more efficient
 2. Requires the number to be specified
 3. Gives only one partitioning of the data based on the predefinded number of clusters
 4. Potentially returns different clusters each time it is due to random initialization of centroids

 Hierarchial Clustering
 ......................
 1. Can be slow for large datasets
 2. Does not require the number of clusters to run
 3. Gives more than one partitioning depending on the resolution
 4. Always generates the same clusters
